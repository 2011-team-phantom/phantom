Live App: https://phantombudget.herokuapp.com/

### Built With

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Sign up with Plaid API [here](https://dashboard.plaid.com/signup) to get a Client ID and Secret.

### Installation

You can run this app in two modes: sandbox or development, based on the API key you have. Use sandbox to connect a test bank account and use development to connect a real bank account.

1. Clone the repo.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/2011-team-phantom/phantom.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a new database in MongoDB called phantomdb.

   ```
   mongo
   use phantomdb
   ```

4. For both sandbox and development mode, create a .env file with your Plaid Client ID, Plaid Secret, and Session Secret.

   ```
   PLAID_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_FROM_PLAID
   PLAID_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET_FROM_PLAID
   SESSION_SECRET='YOUR OWN SECRET'
   ```

   For development mode, also change your Client env in `/server/api/index.js`.

   ```javascript
   const client = new plaid.Client({
     clientID: process.env.PLAID_CLIENT_ID,
     secret: process.env.PLAID_SECRET,
     env: plaid.environments.development,
   });
   ```

5. Start server and run locally.
   ```bash
   npm run start-dev
   ```
6. You can now interact with Plutus app on http://localhost:3000/.
